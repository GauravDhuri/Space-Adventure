# Space Adventure

This is a fun and simple clone of a classic space shooter game that I built for practice and to improve my skills. The project is designed to simulate the basic mechanics of a space shooter, where the player controls a spaceship and must fend off waves of enemies.

## Features

- Player-controlled spaceship: The player can move left and right using keyboard input (arrow keys or WASD) and shoot bullets to destroy enemies.
- Enemy ships: Various types of enemy spaceships that move towards the playerâ€™s ship.
- Bullet mechanics: The player can shoot bullets to destroy enemies. The bullets move upwards and disappear when they go off-screen.
- Collision detection: Bullets and enemies can collide. The player loses health if their spaceship collides with an enemy.

## Technologies Used

Game Engine: Flame Engine
Language: dart
Graphics: Basic pixel art or sprite images (rom free assets).
Sound: Background music and sound effects for shooting and enemy destruction.
